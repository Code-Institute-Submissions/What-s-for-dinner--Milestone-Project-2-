## UX/UI



## Usage

The requirements for this project included the optional use of an external API to produce results based on a call from the user. In this case, the user is presented with a single web page and an input field. The user can then provide a search query (ingredients) inside of the input field (e.g. "chicken", "pasta", "pizza", etc.) upon which the external API (api.edamam.com) is being called to get recipe results. The results are then displayed in a Bootstrap card format below the input field and contain of 10 cards. The cards provide some basic information about the specific recipe such as the name of the meal, the publisher of said recipe, some basic nutrition information, as well as an image of the meal.
